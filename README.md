# Python Script to Scrape Luma's Guest List

## Problem Statement
As a student eager to participate in networking events to make meaningful connections, I've learned the hard way that it's always better to come prepared by doing your research about the people who will attend the event and whom you want to connect with. Recently, I discovered Luma - an app that helps you discover many cool events in different cities around the world (SF included), and many events display a list of guests who will be attending. Thanks to this, I decided to create a scraping script that collects information about the guests and turns them into a spreadsheet to help me keep track of those whom I want to make a connection at the event.
